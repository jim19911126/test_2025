        Mayhem is a studio album by American singer and songwriter Lady Gaga. It was released on March 7, 2025, through
        Streamline and Interscope Records. During the creation of the album, Gaga collaborated with producers such as
        Andrew Watt, Cirkut, and Gesaffelstein, resulting in an album that has a "chaotic blur of genres", mainly
        synth-pop, with industrial dance influences, and elements of electro, disco, funk, industrial pop, rock and pop
        rock. Thematically, it explores love, chaos, fame, identity, and desire, using metaphors of transformation,
        duality, and excess.

        Mayhem received critical acclaim with reviewers deeming it a strong return to form to Gaga's pop roots,
        specifically The Fame (2008). Reviewers highlighted the production, stylistic diversity, album cohesion and
        noted stylistic inspiration from artists such as David Bowie, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Prince, Radiohead, Nine
        Inch Nails and Siouxsie and the Banshees. It became her highest-rated release on Metacritic. Gaga will promote
        the album in 2025 with a series of promotional concerts, including a headlining performance at Coachella, and
        her eighth concert tour, the Mayhem Ball.
